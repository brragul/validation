Do not change any Javascript files. Thanks

Before comparing do the following in excel
	1. Merge cells if a cell is split in two
	2. Only two columns should be copied first one is variable name and second is expected values
	3. Select eVar/prop  near "Compare" button if you are not comparing Context Data Variables. If you dont the result will be erroneous
	4. If the result is ambiguous check if the data copied from excel is valid

Updates coming soon.
